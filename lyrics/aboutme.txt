You were shy
I couldn't agree that we were meant to be but


Our love
Is what they talk about
What they talk about in movies
Our love
Is what they talk about
What they talk about

Yeah, we were wild and free
And you know everything about me
So wild and free
And you know everything about me (me, me)
You know everything about
You know everything about me (me, me)

You know everything about
You know everything about me (me, me)
You know everything about
You know everything about me (me, me)
You know everything about
You know everything about
(Me, me)
You know everything about
You know everything about me (me, me)
You know everything about
You know everything about

Save me from myself
I really need your help
I'm going under
Save me from myself
All I really ever wondered
Is if I'm really going under

Yeah, we were wild and free
And you know everything about me
So wild and free
And you know everything about me (me, me)
You know everything about
You know everything about me (me, me)

You know everything about
You know everything about me (me, me)
You know everything about
You know everything about me (me, me)
You know everything about
You know everything about
(Me, me)
You know everything about
You know everything about me (me, me)
You know everything about
